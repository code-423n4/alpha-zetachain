### Exploiting developer assumptions based on previous exploits/audits

#### **Valid Contract Emissions:**
   - The assumption that any emitted `ZetaSent` event would come from a legitimate or authorized contract, while it might be possible that events could be emitted by arbitrary contracts leading to unauthorized bridge functionality (Zellic 3.1).
#### **Restricted Transaction Manipulation:**
   - Assuming that only certain actors (bonded validators) could influence transactions, while it might be possible to manipulate transaction processing, leading to potential double-spending issues (Zellic 3.2).
#### **Coin Type Verification:**
   - The assumption that the program would only handle Bitcoin transactions when processing `CoinType_Gas` transactions, whereas the findings showed a lack of verification leading to incorrect coin transactions (Zellic 3.3).
#### **Thread Safety:**
   - Assuming that multi-threading operations would work seamlessly without race conditions, whereas a potential double-spend is possible due to race conditions (Zellic 3.4).
#### **Adequate Block Confirmations:**
  - The assumption of single block confirmation sufficiency, a potential double-spend scenario, is possible due to reorganization (Zellic 3.5).
#### **Unique Event Hashing:**
   - Assuming that events with the same parameters would be processed distinctly, while the findings demonstrated a hash collision leading to incorrect transaction processing and potential bridge halting (Zellic 3.6).
#### **Secure Key Handling:**
   - The assumption that node keys would be securely handled, whereas the findings showed a lack of authentication in the `SetNodeKeys` function, posing a potential security risk (Zellic 3.7).
#### **Error-Free Event Parsing:**
   - Assuming error-free parsing of client events, while the findings revealed a missing nil check leading to potential panic within the client (Zellic 3.8).
#### **Accurate Address Checking:**
   - Assuming accurate address checking, whereas the findings demonstrated a case-sensitive check allowing for potential double signing (Zellic 3.9).
####  **Resilient Client Handling:**
    - Assuming the `zetaclient` would be resilient to crashes, whereas the findings showed a lack of panic handling could halt cross-chain communication (Zellic 3.10).
####  **Comprehensive Validation:**
    - Assuming the `ValidateBasic()` function would adequately validate incoming messages, whereas the findings highlighted cases of insufficient validation (Halborn 17).
####  **Accurate Oracle Values:**
   - Developers might assume that oracle values are always accurate and updated frequently enough to reflect the current market prices, which is critical for trading from token X to token Y. However, it might be possible that an out-of-date oracle could occur if the price is not updated frequently enough, or if it's an on-chain oracle, the price could be manipulated unfairly for the system (Bad Oracles).
####  **Correct Token Validation:**
   - There could be an assumption that the intended token sent within the Cosmos SDK is appropriately validated. This is crucial as Cosmos SDK can have many native tokens simultaneously. However, it might be possible that a less valuable asset than intended could be used if proper validation is not carried out (Denom Checks).
#### **Standardized Decimal Handling:**
   - Developers might assume that decimal amounts for tokens are handled or calculated correctly during swaps or price calculations. This assumption could lead to problems if an incorrect decimal amount is assumed, as highlighted in the findings (Decimals).
#### **Reliable Bookkeeping:**
   - Assuming that adding, removing, and transferring funds from an account is accurately tracked by the programmers of a Cosmos SDK blockchain might lead to critical errors. One of the reports in Osmosis showed that the *withdrawal* sent **two times** the amount of tokens that it should have, indicating an issue in bookkeeping (Improper Bookkeeping).
#### **Reliable Evidence Submission:**
   - Developers might assume that the evidence submitted against a node's misbehavior is accurate. However, the findings indicate that a malicious node can submit false evidence to get arbitrary users slashed as the evidence is acted on prior to verification (A byzantine consumer can tombstone, slash, or jail an innocent validator - Cosmos Hub by Informal Systems).

#### **Positive Transaction Values:**
   - There might be an assumption that transactions for `MsgDeposit` and `MsgWithdrawal` always deal with positive numbers. However, the findings reveal that these transactions accept negative numbers, allowing a user to decrease the number of shares within a pool, leading to potential fund theft (Stealing of user funds via negative deposits - Duality Informal Systems).

#### **Unique Escrow Addresses:**
   - Developers may assume that the escrow address calculated using the port ID and channel ID is always unique. However, the findings show that the lack of domain separation and hash collisions due to truncation can result in address collisions, leading to wrong tokens being taken (Escrow Address Collisions - IBC by Informal Systems).

#### **Independent Zone Operations:**
   - There might be an assumption that the failure in one zone does not affect other zones. However, the findings reveal that all zones are tightly coupled currently, and a failure in one zone leads to failures in others (Isolating Host Zone Operations - Stride by Informal Systems).

#### **Secure User Interface Messages:**
   - Developers might assume that transaction information displayed to the user is accurate and secure. However, the findings highlight that arbitrary data can be printed, potentially misleading the user in what they sign (User Interface Message Spoofing - Vega Protocol by OtterSec).

#### **Correct Tick Boundaries:**
   - Developers may assume that the tick boundaries are set correctly in Osmosis liquidity. However, an incorrect comparison operator led to inclusive bounds on the upper end, violating slippage protections and causing other issues (Incorrect Tick Boundary - Osmosis by OtterSec).

####  **Accurate Iterator Initialization:**
   - There might be an assumption that the initialization of iterators, used for calculating ranges correctly, is accurate. However, an off-by-one error during prefix creation for iteration leads to potential pool corruption (Incorrect Tick Iterator Initialization - Osmosis by OtterSec).

####  **Accurate Vote Tallying:**
   - Developers may assume that the voting process correctly tallies the votes. However, the findings reveal that `NoWithVeto` votes were incorrectly counted as 'yes' votes, potentially leading to incorrect voting outcomes (Proposal’s tally returns wrong vote result - Neutron by Oak Security).

####  **Standard Error Handling:**
   - Developers might assume that the `onRecvPacket` function returns a standard Go error message on failure. However, the findings show that it returns an acknowledgment instead, potentially leading to incorrect event emissions and fake bridge deposits (IBC Error Handling Issues - IBC by JumpCrypto).

####  **Precise Rounding:**
   - Developers might assume that rounding operations in the Cosmos SDK are always precise. However, findings suggest that `sdk.Dec` has issues with certain math operations, emphasizing the importance of performing multiplication before division to avoid losing precision. The rounding mechanism, whether it's bankers rounding up or down, should be designed to benefit the module at all times to maintain the integrity of values.

####  **Infinite Integer Values:**
   - Developers may assume that integer values can be infinitely large or small, but in Golang, which the Cosmos SDK utilizes, numbers have a fixed size. When an integer reaches its maximum or minimum size, it will wrap around, similar to a clock's behavior. Understanding and handling integer overflows and underflows are crucial to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
   - References: [Acunetix - What is Integer Overflow](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/what-is-integer-overflow/), [JumpCrypto - Helping Secure BNB Chain](https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/helping-secure-bnb-chain-through-responsible-disclosure/)

####  **Safe Type Casting:**
   - Developers might assume that type casting from one sized integer to another is safe and straightforward. However, truncation occurs during this process, which may lead to significant alteration in the intended values and, consequently, unexpected behaviors and potential vulnerabilities. The truncation aspect of typecasting needs to be well understood and properly handled to ensure the integrity of the system.
   - Reference: [Pwning - Truncation Example](https://pwning.mirror.xyz/RFNTSouIIlHVNmTNDThUVb1obIeN5c1LAiQuN9Ve-ok)

####  **Adequate Access Control Mechanisms:**
   - Developers may assume that access control mechanisms in place are sufficient to prevent unauthorized operations. However, as demonstrated in the Zetachain example, without proper restrictions like voting or administrative access, sensitive functions like `SetNodeKeys` could be exploited, leading to severe issues like a complete DoS or a user-controlled key.
   - References: Zetachain example (in the vulnerabilities section)

####  **Implicit Access Control:**
   - There might be an assumption that certain operations have implicit access restrictions, especially in settings where sensitive configuration parameters are being handled. However, as seen in the Astroport example, lacking explicit access control allowed any user to modify sensitive AMM settings, which could be detrimental to the system’s integrity and security.
   - References: [Astroport Audit](https://github.com/astroport-fi/astroport-audits/blob/main/halborn/Astroport_fi_AMM_Protocol_CosmWasm_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit.pdf)

####  **Contextual Access Control:**
   - Developers might assume that the context (e.g., module or function being accessed) would inherently restrict who can perform certain actions. Yet, instances like the one where a user could reset a circuit breaker on unintended modules depict that without explicit access checks, unintended behaviors can occur.
   - References: [Circuit Breaker Reset Issue](https://hackerone.com/reports/2120609)

#### **Comprehensive Privilege Checks:**
   - It might be assumed that all necessary privilege checks are in place and functioning as intended. However, missing privilege checks, as observed in the Enzyme Finance example, can lead to unauthorized access and potential system exploitation.
   - References: [Enzyme Finance Privilege Check Bugfix Review](https://medium.com/immunefi/enzyme-finance-missing-privilege-check-bugfix-review-ddb5e87b8058)


#### **Sufficient Transaction Cost:**
   - Developers might assume that the cost associated with transactions is sufficient to deter block stuffing. However, with many Cosmos SDK blockchains being cheap on gas, an attacker could potentially congest the network either individually or by sending numerous transactions simultaneously, as observed during Terra's product launches.
   - References: [UST December 2021 Incident](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ust-december-2021)

#### **Fair Transaction Processing:**
   - There could be an assumption that the FIFO (First In, First Out) nature of Cosmos SDK blockchain would inherently prevent frontrunning and block stuffing. However, this FIFO nature doesn't prevent an attacker from stuffing the block with garbage transactions to manipulate asset prices or delay-sensitive updates.

#### **Inherent Priority Handling:**
   - It might be assumed that sensitive or crucial transactions would be inherently prioritized by the system. Yet, without explicit priority messaging, attackers could delay these transactions by stuffing the block, subsequently profiting from the delay.
   - [Reference](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/messages_priority)

#### **Adequate Gas Pricing:**
   - Developers may assume that the existing gas pricing is adequate to prevent malicious actors from congesting the network

#### **Robust Timeout Handling:**
   - Developers might assume that timeout handling mechanisms are robust and fail-safe. However, incorrect error detection could lead to double-spend vulnerabilities, posing risks if original transactions are re-sent post timeout.
   - References: [Huckleberry IBC Event Hallucinations](https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/huckleberry-ibc-event-hallucinations/), [Stride PR #818](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride/pull/818)

#### **Secure Relayer Functionality:**
   - The assumption here could be that relayers or observers are securely designed to accurately relay events between blockchains. Vulnerabilities, or tricking relayers into signing or dropping events, could lead to incorrect asset transfers or halted bridge operations.
   - References: The Zetachain example provided regarding relayer vulnerability.

#### **1:1 Asset Representation:**
   - Developers may assume that the lock+mint and burn+send method maintains a 1:1 asset representation across blockchains. However, inflation or deflation of wrapped tokens could lead to incorrect fund transfers or withdrawals.
   - References: Supply Growth section in the provided text.

#### **Rigorous Input Validation:**
   - There may be an assumption that input validation mechanisms are rigorous and untamperable. However, inadequate input validation can lead to token misrepresentation or other trickery.
   - References: [Thorchain REKT](https://rekt.news/thorchain-rekt/), [Aurora Bugfix Review](https://medium.com/immunefi/aurora-improper-input-sanitization-bugfix-review-a9376dac046f)

#### **Accurate Event Handling:**
   - Developers might assume that event handling systems accurately reflect the events occurring on the blockchain. However, issues like event duplication, spoofing, or incorrect sender checks could lead to incorrect fund transfers or other confused deputy problems.
   - References: [Qubit Hack Jan 2022](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-qubit-hack-january-2022), [Thorchain Hack July 2021](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-thorchain-hack-july-2021)

#### **Fair Voting Mechanism:**
   - In cases where event verification is done via voting, there might be an assumption of a fair voting mechanism. However, issues like double voting, Sybil attacks, or malleable keys could lead to unfair practices and incorrect event verification.
   - References: [Election Fraud in Celer's Network](https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/election-fraud-double-voting-in-celers-state-guardian-network/), [Yearn Security Disclosure](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/disclosures/2022-11-01.md), [Striking Gold at 30,000 Feet](https://medium.com/@blockian/striking-gold-at-30-000-feet-uncovering-a-critical-vulnerability-in-q-blockchain-for-50-000-ab335042147b)

#### **Secure Bridge Integration:**
   - The overarching assumption could be that the bridge integration is secure and handles asset transfers between blockchains correctly. However, various edge cases and vulnerabilities across different aspects of the bridge (like timeouts, relayer functionality, supply growth, etc.) could potentially lead to significant risks.
   - References: [Common Cross-Chain Bridge Vulnerabilities](https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f), [Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities and Bridge Exploits in 2022](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/GuBAYoHdhrS1mK9Nyfyto-cross-chain-vulnerabilities-and-bridge-exploits-in-2022)


#### **Safe Division Operations:**
   - Developers might assume that division operations are safe, however, division by zero is undefined and could lead to crashes, as illustrated in the Zetachain and Osmosis examples.
   - References: [Osmosis Issue #3831](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/3831)

#### **Resource Availability:**
   - Assumptions might be made about the availability of resources, however, bugs like the one in Osmosis' math library or the rapid reset bug in HTTP2 can lead to resource exhaustion, effectively causing denial of service.
   - References: [Dos in Osmosis Math Library](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/10/23/numbers-turned-weapons-dos-in-osmosis-math-library/), [Vulnerability Coordination Retrospective](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/vulnerability-coordination-retrospective-cosmos-mainnet-security-advisory-lavender-2020-04-09/3550), [SUI Temporary Total Network Shutdown](https://medium.com/immunefi/sui-temporary-total-network-shutdown-bugfix-review-c271d0319dcc)

#### **Deterministic Behavior:**
   - Developers might assume deterministic behavior across different executions or nodes, however, non-deterministic elements like map iteration order in Go, floating-point precision differences, or time discrepancies can result in consensus issues or unexpected behaviors.
   - References: [Intentionally Randomized Map Iteration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9619479/go-what-determines-the-iteration-order-for-map-keys), [Go-Cyber Issue #66](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber/issues/66), [Cosmos SDK Vulnerability Retrospective](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-vulnerability-retrospective-security-advisory-jackfruit-october-12-2021/5349)


#### **Mature Infrastructure:**
   - Comparing with Ethereum, there might be an assumption of mature infrastructure in Cosmos-based blockchains. However, as newer blockchains, they might still have vulnerabilities that could lead to entire blockchain crashes.
   - References: The DenialOfService.md file in the vulnerabilities folder.

#### **Consensus Stability:**
   - Assumptions around consensus stability might be made, however, non-deterministic behaviors or other bugs could undermine consensus, leading to network instability or other unexpected outcomes.
   - References: The DenialOfService.md file in the vulnerabilities folder.
#### **Frontrunning Immunity:**
   - Developers might assume that the FIFO buffer nature of the Cosmos SDK blockchain inherently prevents single-chain frontrunning. However, the possibility of collusion between nodes could potentially enable frontrunning scenarios.

#### **Cross-Blockchain Frontrunning:**
   - In a cross-blockchain ecosystem like Zetachain, interacting with different blockchains (e.g., Binance to zEVM) could expose transactions to frontrunning risks. Observing an event on one chain and acting on it on another chain before the intended transaction gets processed could be a potential vulnerability.

#### **Observation and Reaction:**
   - Attackers could potentially observe cross-chain calls in the mempool of one blockchain (e.g., Binance) and react by performing operations on another blockchain (e.g., zEVM) before the intended transaction gets confirmed, exploiting the latency in observer voting processes for adding transactions.

#### **Cross-Chain Interaction Complexity:**
   - The complexity of cross-chain interactions could inadvertently create opportunities for frontrunning, as the time difference or delay in processing transactions between chains could be exploited by malicious actors.

#### **Generalizability of Cross-Chain Frontrunning:**
   - The text suggests that the frontrunning issue is not specific to any two chains but could be a broader problem within the cross-chain interaction context, indicating a need for broader solutions or preventive measures against frontrunning in such environments.

#### **State Consistency**
- Developers might assume that the state will always be consistent. However, bugs, software crashes, or attacks could lead to state inconsistencies.

#### **Transaction Finality**
- Cosmos, with its Tendermint consensus, provides immediate finality. Developers might assume that once a transaction is committed, it's final. However, network issues or forks can challenge this assumption.

#### **Module Interactions**
- When using the Cosmos SDK's modular architecture, developers might assume that modules will always interact seamlessly. However, incorrect module configurations or updates can break these interactions.

#### **Delegations and Staking**
- Developers might assume that the delegation and staking mechanisms are foolproof. However, there are nuances like jailed validators, unbonding periods, and slashing conditions that can affect staking operations.

#### **Upgradeability**
- Developers might assume that upgrades using the upgrade module will always go smoothly. However, incorrect migration scripts or data incompatibilities can lead to issues.

#### **Governance Proposals**
- Developers might assume that governance proposals, once passed, will execute perfectly. In reality, executing a proposal might have unforeseen consequences on the chain's operation.

#### **Cross-chain Interactions**
- With the growing popularity of cross-chain platforms, developers might assume that interactions between Cosmos and other chains (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot) are seamless. However, bridges and peg zones can have their own complexities and vulnerabilities.

#### **Data Availability**
- Developers might assume that data, once stored on-chain, is always readily available. However, large-scale data requests or retrieving historical data can sometimes face challenges, especially on pruned nodes or during network congestion.

#### **Time-Based Operations**
- Developers might rely on block timestamps for time-sensitive operations, thinking they are exact. However, slight discrepancies in block time or manipulation by malicious validators can lead to unpredicted outcomes in time-based logic.
