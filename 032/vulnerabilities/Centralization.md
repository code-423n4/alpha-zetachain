## Centralization 
- The Cosmos ecosystem is made in such a way that it should be *decentralized*.
- If a node goes down, single user cannot make calls anymore then the system needs to keep running.
- Ensure that there is no single point of failure. Otherwise, a single user could bring the system to the ground.
- Ensure that mission critical parameters are managed by the governance.
