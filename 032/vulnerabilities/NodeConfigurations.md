- Cosmos SDK and CometBFT have a multitude of settings. It is highly customizable to the liking of both the node operator and the project itself.
- A few examples of security sensitive settings:
  - Minimum gas price
  - Exposed interfaces for networking
  - Cosmovisor Usage
  - Maximum mempool size
