# Project 101 / FAQ

 # What is ZetaChain?

ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain that enables [omnichain](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/reference/glossary/#omnichain), generic smart contracts and messaging between any blockchain. Smart contracts can be deployed natively on ZetaChain and read/write to any connected chains.

## Architecture

ZetaChain is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, with fast block time (~5s) and instant finality (no confirmation needed, no re-organization allowed). The consensus engine can scale to ~300 nodes in production, and the throughput of transactions can potentially reach 100 TPS.

The architecture consists of a distributed network of nodes, referred to as validators. Validators act as decentralized observers that reach consensus on relevant external state and events, and can also update external chain state via distributed key signing.

### Modules

ZetaChain is composed of 4 custom modules:

- The [crosschain](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/architecture/modules/crosschain/overview/) module tracks inbound and outbound cross-chain transactions (CCTX).
- The [emissions](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/architecture/modules/emissions/overview/)  module is responsible for orchestrating rewards distribution for observers, validators and TSS signers.
- The [fungible](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/architecture/modules/fungible/overview/) module facilitates the deployment of fungible tokens of connected blockchains (called "foreign coins") on ZetaChain.
- The [observer](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/architecture/modules/observer/overview/) module keeps track of ballots for voting, a mapping between chains and observer accounts, a list of supported connected chains, core parameters, observer parameters, and admin policy parameters.

## ZetaChain FAQ

### What is ZetaChain built with? 

- [The ZetaChain blockchain](https://github.com/zeta-chain/node) is written on top of the on the Cosmos SDK and the [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint) EVM-compatibility module.

### How are ZetaChain contracts developed?

- ZetaChain's zEVM is compatible with the EVM, enabling the deployment of standard EVM contracts, just as you would on any other EVM chain.

### How do ZetaChain contracts work across multiple chains?

ZetaChain has an ["Omnichain Contracts”](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/omnichain/overview/) standard, which enables contracts deployed on ZetaChain to manage state and assets on multiple interconnected chains at once. 

Any contract implementing the and contract inheriting implementing the [zContract](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol#L10-L17) interface is able to be used across any connected external chain.
 

### What is the native coin?

- ZETA is ZetaChain's native coin. ZETA is used for many aspects of the network, including as an intermediary token in the case of cross-chain value transfer, as gas for the network, as well as for  incentivizing decentralization in the network — staking, bonding, slashing, etc.

## What can ZetaChain be compared to?

### Blockchain of Blockchains - Cosmos & Polkadot

Cosmos and Polkadot are interoperability-focused ecosystems that encounter compatibility issues, requiring external chains to implement specific standards in order to interact.

### Application-Specific Cross-Chain Blockchain - THORChain

THORChain is a decentralized liquidity network capable of native value transfer with external blockchains, though it does not have generic message passing, only being able to function as a cross-chain DEX.

### Bridges / Messaging - LayerZero & Axelar

Cross-chain messaging solutions like LayerZero and Axelar transfer value between chains using wrapped versions of the assets, which introduces inherent risks and downsides. For more information on the risks associated with wrapped assets, please check out [Advantages and Disadvantages of Wrapped Assets.](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-wrapped-assets-ffe35fa2f566).

ZetaChain takes a more open approach by enabling native cross-chain zEVM smart contracts that can directly send assets and interact with external blockchains, including legacy chains such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin. 

## Start-up FAQ

### What should I do if I'm new to blockchain development in Go?

- The [goethereumbook](https://goethereumbook.org/en/) is a great place to start with blockchain development in Go.
- The Ethereum Foundation also has a page with [links to many Go-for-blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/golang/#intermediate-articles-and-docs) resources.

### What should I do if I'm new to the Cosmos SDK?

- To learn how the Cosmos SDK works on a high level check the [A Technical Introduction to Cosmos SDK](https://medium.com/cypher-core/a-technical-introduction-to-cosmos-sdk-f3a08c85a2b5) article.
