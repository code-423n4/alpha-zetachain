## Project 101

The [Project 101 primer](Project_101.md) will give an already professional and competent security researcher a guide to the ZetaChain platform, how it functions and similarities/differences to other platforms in its class. The primer will streamline on-boarding of security researchers new to or inexperienced with this technology stack. We achieve this objective by analyzing core underlying Cosmos Infrastructure used to build ZetaChain and providing a robust overview of ZetaChainâ€™s current architecture. Furthermore, we deep dive into developer considerations for the zeta-chain/node and outline key resources to accelerate Go learning.

## Testing 101

The [Testing 101 primer](Testing_101_+_Best_Resources.md) will give a competent security researcher a crucial head start on testing the ZetaChain project. We deep dive into Validator Node testing considerations and then go on to outline a robust wider testing strategy. We also outline potential attack vectors and list relevant and valuable resources available to wardens.

This Alpha content is crafted one of the top security researchers active in Code4rena (0xladboy) and researchers would do well to take heed of the recommendations/advice given here!

## Collection & Classes of Vulnerabilities

In Project 101 and Testing 101 we discussed similarities, differences and architectural considerations that should be incorporated when conducting a security review of ZetaChain and/or other Cosmos ecosystem projects. [In this section](Collection_&_Classes_of_Vulnerabilitiesc.md), we will talk about specific vulnerabilities and audit findings that have been reported in relation to ZetaChain and Cosmos projects. Furthermore, we will assign these vulnerabilities into classes where appropriate.
